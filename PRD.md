Key Features

1. Employee Attendance Tracking

Employees can search their names in the system using a search box.

Once their name is selected, they can clock in with a single click.

The system automatically records the current date and time from the client’s device and sends it to the backend.

A clock-in record is created in the database and linked to that specific employee.

Employees can also clock out, creating a complete attendance log for the day.


2. Visitor Management

Visitors access a dedicated Visitor Check-In section.

They search for the employee they are meeting.

They then log the time they arrived (clock in) and later clock out when leaving.

Each visit is stored in the database with visitor details, host employee, and timestamps, creating a complete log of company visitors.


3. Admin Dashboard

Employee Management: Add new employees, update details, or remove employees from the system.

Record Viewing: Access a structured log of attendance records (clock-ins/outs) for all employees and visitors.

Database Integration: All attendance and visitor data is stored in a centralized database for easy retrieval, reporting, and auditing.

User Control: Ensure only authorized admins can manage employees and view sensitive records.

How It Works (System Flow)

1. Admin Setup:

Admin logs in → Creates employee profiles in the system (Name, ID, Department, etc.).

Employee records are saved in the database.



2. Employee Usage:

Employee opens the front-end interface.

Searches and selects their name.

Clicks Clock In / Clock Out → App captures timestamp and sends it to backend.

Database stores the record as { EmployeeID, Date, Time, Action (IN/OUT) }.



3. Visitor Usage:

Visitor selects the “Visitor” option.

Searches for the employee they are visiting.

Clicks Clock In at arrival, then Clock Out on departure.

Database stores record as { VisitorName, HostEmployeeID, Date, Time, Action (IN/OUT) }.



4. Admin Management:

Admin logs in to view reports.

Attendance records and visitor logs can be filtered by employee, date, or status.
